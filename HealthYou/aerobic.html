            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Aerobic exercise provides cardiovascular conditioning. The term aerobic actually means "with oxygen," which means that breathing controls the amount of oxygen that can make it to the muscles to help them burn fuel and move. The American Heart Association recommends a minimum of 30 minutes of cardiovascular exercise 5 to 7 days per week. Don't forget warm-up, cool-down and stretching exercises in your aerobic exercise session.</br></br>

            <h7 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;"> Exercise Safety</h7>
            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is recommended that you talk with your physician before you start an exercise program. Ask what, if any, limitations you may have. People who suffer from diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, arthritis, pulmonary conditions, or other health conditions may need additional safety guidelines for exercise.</br>

Note: If you develop symptoms during exercise including, but not limited to, unusual shortness of breath; tightness in the chest; chest, shoulder, or jaw pain; lightheadedness; dizziness; confusion; or joint pain, you should stop exercising immediately and contact your physician.</p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;"> What are some examples of aerobic exercise? </h5>
            <p> Lower impact aerobic exercise includes:</br>
            <ul>
              <li>Swimming</li>
              <li>Cycling</li>
              <li>Using an Elliptical Trainer</li>
              <li>Walking</li>
              <li>Rowing</li>
              <li>Using an upper body ergometer (a piece of equipment that provides a cardiovascular workout that targets the upper body only).</li>
            </ul></br></p>
            <p>Higher impact aerobic exercise includes:
            <ul>
              <li>Running</li>
              <li>Jumping Rope</li>
              <li>Performing high impact routines or step aerobics.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h5 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;">How often and for how long should I do these exercises?</h5>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The American Heart Association recommends that everyone reach a minimum of 30 minutes of some form of cardiovascular exercise 5 to 7 days per week. This can be broken up into 10-minute time periods. This means that taking 3 walks of 10 minutes each would let you reach the recommended minimum guideline for reducing the risk of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. You would also burn the same number of calories as you would if you walked for the full 30 minutes at 1 time.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The American College of Sports Medicine recommends a minimum of 3 sessions of 30 minutes of the total should be made up of moderate to vigorous exercise to improve cardio-respiratory fitness and help manage weight.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is appropriate to do aerobic exercise every day. There is no need to rest in between sessions unless you are at an extreme level of training, such as preparing for a marathon, or if you experience reoccurring joint pain. If joint pain is a limiting factor, it would be appropriate to alternate less painful exercises with those that may cause joint pain or discontinue the painful exercise altogether.</br></p>

            <h7 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;">Explanation of intensity</h7>

            <p> The intensity is determined by how hard you are working. The intensity of the exercise is determined by what your goals are, what limitations you have, and your current fitness level.
            </p>

              <h7 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;">Heart rate and exercise</h7>
              <p>In the West, the word “yoga” has come to mean a particular style called hatha yoga. This branch emphasizes postures (asanas), breathing exercises (pranayama), stress relief, relaxation, physical fitness and wellness. The focus is primarily on the physical body which differs from traditional yoga, where the focus is more inward and spiritual. There are many schools of hatha, each with its own unique style and philosophy.</p></br> 
 
              <h7 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;">Monitoring intensity in other ways</h7>
              <p>How can you know if you are working at the right intensity? Using an RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) chart can help you to determine the appropriate intensity. The scale uses a 1 to 10 rating system. One is very light, such as walking to the refrigerator for a glass of milk. Ten would be a very significant level, representing maximal exercise. Ten would be indicative of not being able to take another step without fear of collapse. It is not recommended for anyone to work at a rate of 10 without strict supervision by a healthcare provider. Moderate intensity is the level of exercise that is most recommended, and can be determined by a rating between a 3 and a 5.</p></br>

              <h7 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;">Warming up and cooling down</h7>
              <p>Every session of aerobic exercise should include a warm-up and cool-down. The warm-up period should not include static stretching, but should instead be a gradual increase in pace and intensity of the exercise. This allows the body to increase blood flow to the muscles and decreases the likelihood of a muscle or joint injury. The warm-up should last between 5 and 10 minutes. The cool-down session should last a similar amount of time as the warm-up, with the pace gradually decreasing. Stretching exercises would be appropriate after aerobic exercise.</p></br>

              <h7 style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 20px; color: palevioletred;">Progression of aerobic exercise</h7>
              <p>Progression to higher intensities of exercise should be based on individual exercise tolerance. There are 3 methods for challenging aerobic fitness:
                <ul>
                  <li>Increase Speed</li>
                  <li>Increase the Resistance</li>
                  <li>Increase the Duration</li>
                </ul></p>
                <p>Any of these methods, or a combination of these methods, will improve aerobic fitness. Increasing intensity should be done very gradually. You should challenge yourself for only a few minutes at a time.
